## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### UnicodeDecodeError when reading CSV
```python
# Try different encodings in order of preference
encodings = ['utf-8', 'latin1', 'ISO-8859-1', 'cp1252']
df = None

for encoding in encodings:
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding=encoding)
        print(f"Successfully loaded with {encoding} encoding")
        break
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        continue

if df is None:
    raise ValueError("Could not read file with any supported encoding")
```

#### Memory Issues with Large Datasets
```python
# Use chunked reading for large files
chunk_size = 10000
chunks = []

for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size, low_memory=False):
    # Process each chunk
    processed_chunk = preprocess_data(chunk)
    chunks.append(processed_chunk)

df = pd.concat(chunks, ignore_index=True)
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

# For conda users
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

#### Model Performance Issues
- **Low R² Score**: Check for data quality issues, outliers, or need for feature engineering
- **High RMSE**: Consider ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning
- **Overfitting**: Apply regularization techniques or reduce model complexity
- **Underfitting**: Add more features or use more complex algorithms
